# Link022: an open WiFi access point
Link022 is an open reference implementation and experimental platform for an OpenConfig and gNMI
controlled WiFi access point.

The central part of Link022 is an gNMI agent that runs on a Linux host with WiFi capability. The
agent turns the host into an gNMI capable wireless access point which can be configured using
OpenConfig models.
